# LangGraph Agent Builder

**LangGraph Agent Builder** is an AI-powered **multi-agent system** built with [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph).  
It enables natural language requests to be transformed into working projects — file by file — by simulating a team of specialized AI agents.



## LangGraph Workflow - Agent Architecture

- **Planner Agent** → Understands your request and creates a detailed plan.  
- **Architect Agent** → Breaks the plan into concrete engineering tasks, with explicit context for each file.  
- **Coder Agent(s)** → Implement tasks, write directly into files, and use developer-like workflows.  



##  Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed  
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/)  

### Steps
1. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

3. **Set environment variables**

   * Copy `.sample_env` → `.env`
   * Add your Groq API key and other values

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ````

##  Example Prompts

You can ask the agent system to build:

* “Create a to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.”
* “Build a calculator web app.”
* “Generate a blog API in FastAPI with a SQLite database.”


##  Tech Stack

* **Python** 
* **LangGraph** (agent orchestration)
