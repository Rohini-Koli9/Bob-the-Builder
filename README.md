# 🤖 LangGraph Agent Builder

**LangGraph Agent Builder** is an AI-powered **multi-agent system** built with [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph).  
It enables natural language requests to be transformed into working projects — file by file — by simulating a team of specialized AI agents.

## 🧩 Agent Architecture

- **Planner Agent** → Understands your request and creates a detailed plan.  
- **Architect Agent** → Breaks the plan into concrete engineering tasks, with explicit context for each file.  
- **Coder Agent(s)** → Implement tasks, write directly into files, and use developer-like workflows.
